## 4. Common Strategy Templates

The system will provide pre-built strategy templates that can be customized:

- **Moving Average Crossover**: Trading based on short and long-term moving average signals
- **Bollinger Bands**: Trading based on price movements relative to volatility bands
- **Momentum Strategies**: Trading based on relative strength indicators
- **Mean Reversion**: Trading based on deviations from historical means
- **Multi-factor Models**: Combining various technical and fundamental factors

Strategies will be implemented with optimized CUDA kernels for maximum performance.
